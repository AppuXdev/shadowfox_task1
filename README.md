#Shadow Fox Internship — Task 1
*Visualization Library Documentation*
This task involves creating a comprehensive guide for five Python visualization libraries — Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Bokeh, and Pandas. The documentation focuses on the variety of graphs each library can generate, with practical examples and code snippets.
#Folder Structure
- `task1_visualization/`
  - `documentation/`
    - `Visualization_Library_Documentation_Task1.docx`: Final Word document submission
# Libraries Covered
- *Matplotlib*: Core plotting library for static visualizations
- *Seaborn*: Statistical plots with Pandas integration
- *Plotly*: Interactive, web-ready charts
- *Bokeh*: Browser-based interactive visualizations
- *Pandas*: Quick plotting from DataFrames
#Highlights
- Each library section includes:
  - Overview and use cases
  - Supported chart types
  - Code examples with explanations
  - Optional output screenshots
# Tools Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook for testing)
- Word (for final documentation)
- GitHub (for version control and submission)
This guide serves as a reference for choosing the right visualization tool based on interactivity, complexity, and data structure. It demonstrates proficiency in Python plotting libraries and documentation clarity.
